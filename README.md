# Detection-and-Traking-System
As a part of Software engineering course, I have jointly developed this software in a group of four. The Image and video generation of the targets were developed and these codes are available in this repository

This repository contains 7 functions with each of its description given below:

1) Displayimg():  This function generates a mesh diagram  of the target at various instances during the traversal. 
2) img_coll(): This function displays the generated images in a rectangular montage. 
3) streak(): This function creates a streak to depict the traversal of the target.
4) vid_gen(): The vid_gen() generates a video of the traversal of the target, by using the images generated by the img_gen() function.
5) img_gen(): This function is used for the generation of input images which will be further used by the other functions in this project which implement various filter methods. The images generated are grayscale images of the gaussian plume target.
6) natsort(): Implements natural sort.
7) seg(): Segmentationof the image is done to specifically locate the target in the image(visual purposes)
